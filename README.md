# Palmeira do Vale's Project
This is a student project used for practicing SQL, OLTP environment, OLAP environment, ETL, DW, Stage area, etc. 

# Purpourse of this project
This project was conceived for practicing SQL and the Business Intelligence methodology, since I am new to this field and I am seeking to reallocate myself in a new job position. 

# Very important observation!
Although the idea for this project came while I was chatting with a relative, it was only easier and possible because of the aid of my friend and experienced BI Analyst Tulio Brasileiro. My friend, many thanks for your tutorship!

# Description of the Project - 1st phase (OLTP)
After the proper project's documentation settled between the imaginary IT company and its client, the project began with the logical model and then the script for the OLTP environment. Everything was checked by my friend Tulio and I learnt from him how to properly type the code for a good-looking view of the code organization. After this phase, we started to migrate the data to the STAGING AREA.

# 2nd phase (STAGE)
At the STAGING AREA, we created the STAGE's logical model and then the script. Through coding, we transferred the data from the OLTP environment and treated the codes for adjusting them for the correct projections whished by the client in the final result.

# 3th phase (DW)
We created the DW's logical model and then the script. Through coding (not SISS), we transferred the data from the STAGING AREA to the DW (Data Warehouse). 

# 4th phase (PowerBI)
After the OLTP -> OLAP phases, we connected the treated data from the DW into the Microsoft PowerBI tool. The reports were created to help the training and practice of this popular tool in the Business Intelligence methodology.
